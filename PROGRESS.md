## Where I left off (read me first)
**Phase 1 · Task 1 (Project skeleton & tooling baseline) is DONE.** The repo is now a working Laravel 11
app (PHP pinned `^8.3`, strict types everywhere via Pint) with Sanctum + API v1 (`/api/v1`, `apiPrefix`
in `bootstrap/app.php`), Horizon, Browsershot, spatie/laravel-permission and google/apiclient installed.
PHPStan runs at **level max** (`composer run stan`, clean), Pint is clean, and the test suite is green
(3 tests; sqlite in-memory via `phpunit.xml`). Both React 18 + TS SPAs (`resources/js/admin`,
`resources/js/portal`) build with Vite 5 + the locked stack (TanStack Query/Table, Zustand, RHF+Zod,
Lucide, Framer Motion, Inter loaded locally, Tailwind prefix `ir-`). A `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
lints/tests the backend and builds both SPAs. **Next action: Phase 1 · Task 2 — multi-tenant scaffolding**
(`ir_agencies`, agency global scope, `ir_users` + Sanctum auth, base migrations). Note: this environment
has no MariaDB/Redis running — `.env` targets them for production, but tests use sqlite/array/sync.

---

## Current phase
**Phase 1 — Core engine + immediate value**

## Current task
**Phase 1 · Task 2 — Multi-tenant scaffolding** (not started).
`ir_agencies` table + `Agency` model, an `agency_id` global scope applied to all tenant-scoped models,
`ir_users` (extend the default `User` with `agency_id` + `role` owner/admin/collaborator) wired to Sanctum,
and the base migrations. Add the tenant-isolation feature test (agency A can never read agency B's data,
`CLAUDE.md` §14). Wire spatie/laravel-permission (publish/run its migration) if roles use it, otherwise
keep the simple `role` enum per `CLAUDE.md` §5 — confirm which (see Open questions).

### Task 1 — Project skeleton & tooling baseline ✅ DONE (2026-06-18)
- [x] Laravel 11 (11.54) scaffolded; PHP pinned `^8.3`; `declare(strict_types=1)` enforced by Pint.
- [x] Installed: Sanctum (+`install:api`, `/api/v1` prefix), Horizon, Browsershot, spatie/laravel-permission,
      google/apiclient, Larastan (dev). PHPStan **level max** clean; Pint clean.
- [x] `.env`/`.env.example` target MariaDB + Redis (queue/cache/sessions = redis); tests use sqlite/array/sync.
- [x] `composer run stan` / `composer pint` / `composer test` scripts; `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (PHP lint+stan+test, Node typecheck+lint+build both SPAs).
- [x] Two Vite 5 + React 18 + TS SPAs (`admin`, `portal`) with locked stack; Tailwind prefix `ir-`; Inter local; `cn()` util + design tokens. `npm run build` produces both bundles.
- [x] `/api/v1/health` liveness route (+ feature test) for the updater health check.

## Next up (Phase 1, in order)
1. **(current)** Multi-tenant scaffolding: `ir_agencies`, agency global scope, `ir_users` + Sanctum auth, base migrations.
2. `DataSourceConnector` interface + `ConnectorRegistry` + `MetricCatalog` + `MetricSet` (metric bag).
3. Snapshot pipeline: `ir_data_sources`, `ir_metric_snapshots`, `SyncSourceJob`, `SyncService` (idempotent, aggregate-at-source).
4. Connector: **MainWP** (+ `MaintenanceDeltaCalculator` for "work done" deltas).
5. Connector: **GA4** (Service Account; catalog-driven, aggregated).
6. Connector: **Search Console** (Service Account; catalog-driven).
7. Block model + `BlockRenderer` React library + default narrative template (`CLAUDE.md` §11.5).
8. `ReportGenerator` (resolve blocks against snapshots) + `HealthScoreCalculator`.
9. Report React page + portal route + Browsershot PDF (single source of truth).
10. Admin SPA: clients/sites, data-source config (driven by `configSchema()`), manual generation + preview.
11. API v1 endpoints for all of the above (manual generation only).
12. Phase 1 Definition of Done: tests green, PHPStan max clean, end-to-end demo of a manual report.

## Completed
- [x] (2026-06-18) **Phase 1 · Task 1 — Project skeleton & tooling baseline.** Laravel 11 + Sanctum/API v1,
      Horizon, Browsershot, laravel-permission, google/apiclient; PHPStan max + Pint clean; 3 tests green;
      two Vite 5/React 18 SPAs (admin+portal) with the locked stack; CI workflow building both SPAs. — 99135e8

## Decisions log
> History of locked decisions so any new conversation has full context. Append new ones with date + rationale.

- (2026-06-18) **Product name: Imagina Reports.** Working name, confirmed by owner.
- (2026-06-18) **Environment: Hetzner VPS managed by ServerAvatar** (stack OLS, LSPHP 8.3/8.4, MariaDB, Redis).
  Rationale: this app polls many external APIs on schedule for many clients — hostile to shared hosting
  (exec-time limits, throttling, capped cron). VPS is the operator's domain; the "installable anywhere"
  philosophy belongs to the WordPress plugins, not to this operator-run platform.
- (2026-06-18) **API-first** (REST `/api/v1` + Sanctum), multi-tenant, with webhooks. Rationale: owner wants
  it expandable and possibly commercial (other agencies / integrations / future mobile app). Dual auth:
  cookie for own SPAs, API tokens for third parties.
- (2026-06-18) **Two React 18 SPAs** (admin + interactive client portal), built in GitHub Actions; **Node.js
  NOT installed on the server**. Rationale: reuse owner's React stack; portal gives Looker-parity interactivity.
- (2026-06-18) **Redis + persistent worker + Horizon** (available in all ServerAvatar stacks).
- (2026-06-18) **PDF via headless Chromium (Browsershot)** printing the same React report page → single source
  of truth (one `BlockRenderer` for editor, portal, and PDF). VPS isolation contains Chromium RAM spikes.
- (2026-06-18) **Block-based report model** with a **dnd-kit + Tiptap editor** (owner's established pattern
  from Imagina Signatures/Proposals). Reports are blocks bound to metrics, not fixed sections.
- (2026-06-18) **Metrics are NOT hardcoded** — connectors expose a `MetricCatalog`; editor + AI pick freely.
- (2026-06-18) **`AiReportBuilder`** creates a full draft (validated block JSON, constrained to the real
  catalog — cannot invent data) + per-period narrative, via `gpt.imagina.cloud`. "Create a report in seconds."
- (2026-06-18) **Performance golden rule: aggregate at the source, never pull raw rows.** This is why GA4's
  millions of visits never touch the app — GA4/GSC/Cloudflare/Woo aggregate server-side. The `database`
  connector must `GROUP BY` on the client's DB. NOT a BI engine; do not try to replicate Power BI.
- (2026-06-18) **Atomic releases (symlink) + in-app Update/Rollback** (`UpdateManager`); CI builds a
  self-contained ZIP (vendor + compiled assets). Reuses the **Imagina Updater** mechanism.
- (2026-06-18) **Replaces Modular DS + MainWP Pro Reports.** Maintenance "work done" is computed by diffing
  MainWP snapshots (its REST API exposes current state, not a historical work log).
- (2026-06-18) **VirusDie via the MainWP Virusdie extension**, not VirusDie's partner API (avoids the contract).
- (2026-06-18) **Spec language: English** (for Claude Code). Client-facing report content is localized (ES default).
- (2026-06-18) **Dev env runs PHP 8.4, but `composer.json` pins `^8.3`** (the locked target). 8.4 is backward-compatible for local work.
- (2026-06-18) **Vite pinned to 5** (`^5.4`) to honor the locked frontend stack, even though `laravel new` shipped Vite 6.
- (2026-06-18) **PHPStan analyses `app`/`bootstrap/app.php`/`database`/`routes` at level max; `config/` is excluded.**
  Rationale: the framework's `config/*.php` are declarative `env()`-based defaults (typed `bool|string`) that produce
  only false positives, not domain signal. `checkModelProperties` left off for now (it rewrites Factory return types
  and fights Laravel's factories); revisit once models/factories exist.
- (2026-06-18) **API prefix is `/api/v1`** via `withRouting(apiPrefix: 'api/v1')`; added `/api/v1/health` as the
  updater's liveness probe (CLAUDE.md §12.5), separate from Laravel's `/up`.
- (2026-06-18) **Tests run on sqlite in-memory + array cache/session + sync queue** (`phpunit.xml`); production `.env`
  targets MariaDB + Redis. Keeps CI/tests hermetic without external services.
- (2026-06-18) **Roles: simple `role` enum on `ir_users`** (owner/admin/collaborator) per §5 — owner-confirmed.
  spatie/laravel-permission stays installed but reserved for finer-grained per-agency permissions later, not the 3 base roles.

---

## Open questions / blockers
- **`gpt.imagina.cloud` contract:** confirm the request/response shape and auth for the AI endpoint before
  building `AiReportBuilder` (Phase 2). Add env vars `GPT_IMAGINA_ENDPOINT` / `GPT_IMAGINA_KEY`.
- **Chromium path on the VPS:** verify the real binary path when installing on ServerAvatar/OLS; set
  `BROWSERSHOT_CHROME_PATH` accordingly.
- **Imagina Audit API (Phase 3):** confirm it exposes its 7-module metrics + WPVulnerability data as a
  readable REST API before building the `imagina_audit` connector.
- **GA4/GSC Service Account:** owner must add the SA email as a reader in each GA4 property and GSC property.

---

## Environment notes
- Hosting: Hetzner VPS via ServerAvatar. Stack: OLS, LSPHP 8.3/8.4, MariaDB, Redis.
- Repos on GitHub; assets built in GitHub Actions; releases as self-contained ZIPs (or via Imagina Updater).
- Deploy: atomic releases (`releases/`, `shared/`, `current` symlink); OLS custom webroot → `current/public`.
- Connector credentials stored encrypted in `ir_data_sources.credentials` (Laravel encrypted cast). Never log them.
- Test accounts/keys: _(record here as you obtain them — MainWP dashboard token, GA4 SA JSON, GSC, etc.)_
